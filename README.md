# ATM Simulation System

This is a simple simulation of an ATM machine implemented in Java. It allows users to view balance, withdraw, deposit, view a mini statement, and exit the ATM system.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following classes:

- **MainClass.java**: This is the main entry point for the ATM simulation. It handles user interaction and allows the user to choose from various ATM operations.
- **AtmOperationImpl.java**: This class implements the ATM operations such as viewing balance, withdrawing, depositing, and viewing the mini statement.
- **AtmOperationInterf.java**: This interface defines the methods that must be implemented for the ATM operations.
- **ATM.java**: Contains details and logic related to the ATM account and transactions.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ATM-Simulation-System.git
    ```

2. Compile the Java files inside the `src` directory:
    ```bash
    javac src/*.java
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java src/MainClass
    ```

## Usage

- Enter the ATM number and PIN to access the system.
- Choose from available options: view balance, withdraw, deposit, view mini statement, or exit.
- The system will handle your request accordingly.
